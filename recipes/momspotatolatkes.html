    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>"Before you put the potato mixture in the pan, take the scoop and make sure to drain the liquid out by holding
        the spoonful of potato against the side of the bowl," suggests recipe submitter and Allrecipes Allstar Lindsay.
    </p>
    <p>"I was missing Mom last night and craving this meal, and I was very happy with how the latkes turned out," says
        cecefltrn. "I layered the shredded potatoes with paper towels in a large bowl to absorb the excess moisture,
        which worked well."</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups shredded potato</li>
        <li>¼ cup grated onion</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>6 saltine crackers, or as needed, crushed</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>½ cup vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix potato, onion, eggs, crushed crackers, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Heat 1/4 inch oil in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Drop spoonfuls of the potato mixture, first pressing potato mixture against the side of the bowl to remove
            excess liquid, into the hot oil; slightly flatten the latkes into the oil with the back of your spoon so
            they are an even thickness.
        </li>
        <li>Cook in batches in the hot oil until browned and crisp, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Drain latkes on a paper
            towel-line plate.</li>
    </ol>
